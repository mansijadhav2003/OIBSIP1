            Sandeep maheswari is a successful entrepreneur, a guide and obviously a youth icon for many. He decided to help
            countless struggling models who were witnessing the harassment and exploitation. So to achieve his dream he set
            up his own company which was shut down within six months. Thereafter he launched imagesbazaar at the age of 26 
            and brought a paradigm shift in the modelling world. His urge to help didn't end here. He decided to change
            people's lives in the form of free life-changing seminars and sessions inculcating people by his simple mantra 
            aasaan hai.
